# STATUS — per-branch heartbeat (append one line per milestone; owned per-branch, never merged across)

2026-06-10 · P0 · Phase 0 bootstrap in progress.

## C2 — Panels (branch ws/c2-panels)

2026-06-10 · C2 · Accordion UX round 2 (Chrome-verified, 0 console errors, build green).
(1) Explicit collapse: open panels get a ˄ chevron + clickable title that collapse them;
all-collapsed (all strips) is allowed. Renamed the follow control to a clear switch
"Auto-follow: On/Off" (role=switch) so it's not mistaken for navigation; OFF keeps the
current panel pinned. (2) Long-step feedback: the active Mission Control step shows a
shimmering gerund + live elapsed seconds ("Tracing… 38s", reduced-motion-safe) so a slow
step never reads as stuck. Verified collapse/expand/title-toggle/auto-follow toggle live in
the connected browser.


2026-06-10 · C2 · UI polish sprint done (5 items, committed individually, tsc + vite build
green per item, replay stable for recording — full ?demo=replay run has 0 console errors).
(1) Accordion rail + follow-the-agent (default ON): one run-phase panel expanded, others
become summary strips with live counters; follow auto-tracks plan.active_step
(scan/trace→Mission, exposures→Action, gate→Mission, brief→Decision); manual strip click
pins + turns follow off; Follow control resumes. (2) Numbers alive: $ count-up tween,
slide-in/flash on new decisions + tool chips, status-pill pulse on at_risk→secured, brief
headline flash. (3) First-open intro overlay (3 bullets + "Watch a live incident"),
localStorage-remembered, suppressed under ?demo=replay, portaled to body. (4) Action Board
rows: 58px touch targets + always-visible bordered chevron affordance. (5) Click-to-fly.
All motion respects prefers-reduced-motion.

### ★ NEW for C1 (Map) — wire the click-to-fly listener
Decision Log/Mission Control evidence chips and Action Board rows now dispatch on click:
  `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("faultline:focus", { detail: { lat, lon, label, url? } }))`
C1's map should `window.addEventListener("faultline:focus", e => flyTo(e.detail))`. No-op
today (nothing listens). Verified payloads: row→{22.31,73.18,"Trailpoint Granola Bar",gdacs},
chip→ same epicenter w/ place-name label. (Constant `FOCUS_EVENT` in panels/_shared/focus.ts.)

### New C2-owned files under panels/_shared/ (sole writer C2; for F's ownership map)
accordion.tsx (accordion + follow UI store), anim.tsx (count-up + reduced-motion),
IntroOverlay.tsx, focus.ts (faultline:focus dispatch). Plus store.ts/ui.tsx/panels.css and
the four panel index.tsx. NOTE: sparkline draw-in (polish item 2) lives in the analytics
panel = Session G's `features/analytics/` — out of C2's ownership, not done here.


2026-06-10 · C2 · All four panels built and verified end-to-end on replay (ws_replay.jsonl
via C1's getEventStream). Mission Control (goal · numbered plan w/ amber active step ·
streaming tool-call chips with distinct Elastic MCP badges · evidence chips · confidence
meter · Approve/Edit gate wired to approval.decision), Action Board (ranked exposures ·
mono metrics · status pills · expandable alternate+contingent-PO+verify · live call_event
transcript), Decision Log (situation-report header w/ $-averted + GET /report/{run_id}
download · timestamped timeline · evidence chips linking source world-events), What-If
(form + 4 contract presets + magnitude slider → POST /whatif & ws whatif.run · amber
SIMULATED frame). Headless (Playwright/msedge) capture confirms the full SENSE→…→VERIFY
run renders correctly; at_risk→secured transition reflects verify_result. tsc clean for
all C2 files. Swaps replay→live at S2 with zero code change (stream selector is C1's).

### Notes for C1 (lib/) — read-only consumer feedback, NOT edits by C2
- NEW FOLDER: `web/src/panels/_shared/` is C2-owned panel-support (store.ts normalizes the
  ws stream once → useSyncExternalStore; format.ts, ui.tsx, panels.css). Sole writer C2.
  Logged here for F's ownership map (not one of the four named panel folders).
- `lib/replay.ts:24` — `'prev' is possibly null` blocks `tsc -b` (and thus `npm run build`).
  Narrowing is lost inside the setTimeout arrow; hoist `const d = t - prev` before the
  closure or assert. C2 cannot fix (C1 file). Currently the only tsc error in the tree.
- `lib/replay.ts` stops the stream permanently once `handlers.size === 0`. React
  StrictMode's mount→cleanup→remount makes per-component subscribe/unsubscribe hit 0 and
  kill replay. C2 sidesteps it with ONE module-level subscription that never unsubscribes,
  but other consumers (Map, header) may trip on it. Suggest: don't stop on 0, or make the
  stream resumable.
- Boot `status` (seq 0) is delivered synchronously inside `createReplayStream()` before any
  subscriber exists, so it's lost; the next status is at run-end. Header mode chip will read
  empty mid-run. Suggest replaying seq 0 to late subscribers, or buffering the last status.
  (C2's Mission Control infers mode from run data as a workaround.)
